            <p>Abandoned carts are a frustrating reality for ecommerce businesses. All shoppers abandon the occasional cart. You may be just about to check out of your online cart when you get pulled away. Or you suddenly discover that shipping will cost as much as the items you want to buy. Whatever the reason, 71% of carts across the Americas are abandoned before purchase, and retailers lose a corresponding amount of revenue between $111 billion and $136 billion. 

                That’s what makes your abandoned cart email so important — and well-crafted abandoned cart email subject lines are the first step in reuniting wayward shoppers with their purchases.
                
                Why writing effective abandoned cart email subject lines is important
                If you want to recover your share of potential sales, you need to follow all the abandoned cart email best practices — starting with using one of the best abandoned cart email subject lines.
                
                Abandoned cart emails are sent automatically when someone abandons their shopping cart, and they can be highly effective if done right. In fact, these emails have an incredibly high open rate of 48%. And those opened emails lead 21% of recipients to click through to their shopping cart.
                
                These statistics mean you have an excellent opportunity to retrieve otherwise lost sales. But unless your recipients open their abandoned cart emails, there’s no chance of winning them back. You need to put them in the right mood to read — and buy — from your brand with a strong opening.
                
                Remember: These shoppers have already indicated an interest in your product. They’re the best lead you have. Recapture their interest before they’ve turned to a competitor.</p>
