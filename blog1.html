			<p>While spring officially starts in March, I don’t really believe it’s here until April. 

                It’s always sometime in April when I take that deep breath of air that really feels like spring. You know the air I’m talking about. It’s just a bit warmer than the last breath, and while you can’t quite put your finger on why, somehow, it just tastes like warm sunshine, fresh grass, and the promise of summer.
                
                With that breath, that first real taste of spring, I let go of winter and embrace the promise of the coming summer.
                
                I wish everyone could experience that. But no matter where you live, or what April feels like to you, make the most of this month by tapping into these April holidays and newsletter ideas to share the hope and promise of warmer, sunnier days ahead with your readers.
                
                April holidays — 2023
                Depending on your brand, April Fool’s Day might not be the best day to celebrate with your customers. However, here are some April holidays that should definitely be considered.
                
                April 5th — First Contact Day. If you’re a Trekkie, you know what I’m talking about.
                April 7th — Walk to Work Day. Encourage your readers, and employees, to reduce carbon emissions and breath some fresh air on their daily commute (even if it’s a matter of getting off the bus one stop early).
                April 9th — Easter.
                April 9th — National Unicorn Day. Nothing is quite so elusive — except maybe a sale on the one item that never goes on sale.
                April 11th — National Pet Day. Share the love.
                April 14th — National Gardening Day and National Garden Month. Got dirt?
                April 16th — Wear Pajamas to Work Day. If it’s right for your brand, get in the spirit — have your employees “pay” to wear their PJs and donate all the “payments” to a local charity. Let your readers know of the plan and invite them to wear PJs into your store to have a portion of their purchase donated to charity.
                April 20th — National High Five Day. Check the link. Watch the video. Do good things in your community.
                April 22nd — Earth Day. It’s our home. Let’s take care of it.
                April 26th — Administrative Professionals Day. Hug them. Thank them. Give them a spa day — or at least a nice plant for their desk.
                April 28th — National Arbor Day. Get your employees and customers together and plant some trees in your community.
                April 29th — National Rebuilding Day is the culmination of National Rebuilding Month. Help rebuild your community.</p>
