                Think about the last time you made a purchase — big or small. Did you happen to look for reviews on Google before buying? Most of your customers will. In fact, nearly 95 percent of shoppers read online reviews before making a purchase, and 97 percent of shoppers say that reviews on Google and other sites influence their buying decisions.
                
                Why do reviews on Google matter?
                In a recent article on Think with Google, Google’s VP of Marketing for the Americas, Lisa Gevelber, goes into detail about consumers making quick decisions and acting on those decisions faster than ever before. The focus of the article is the concept of micro-moments, a term coined by Gevelber and the leadership of Google that represents the moment a consumer needs to know something, go somewhere, do something, or buy something. 
                
                Micro-moments occur throughout the day for everyone:
                
                If you’re hungry and traveling, you look for a local restaurant
                If your car breaks down on the way to the restaurant, you look for a mechanic
                If you get home and find a pool of water in your kitchen, you look for a plumber
                If you slip in the puddle and hurt your back, you look for a chiropractor and so on
                In essence, consumers are reacting in real-time to micro-moments where they find, go, do, or buy as the need arises. When making these quick decisions, consumers use indicators like reviews on Google to determine where they spend their money. Today, we’re going to look at how you can win new business in today’s micro-moment world by growing positive reviews on Google with the help of email marketing.
                
                Reviews on Google drive buying decisions
                Years ago, I was giving my daughter Olivia a bath when I heard my wife yelling from downstairs, “Bryan, the kitchen is flooded!” It turns out the bathtub was causing a downpour through the kitchen ceiling, and I instantly found myself in a micro-moment. I needed a plumber to fix this leak, so we could continue to use the bathtub without a rainforest effect in our kitchen. With that, I picked up my phone and used Google’s voice search to find a “plumber near me.” The first result in the local pack was a plumber in my town with several five-star reviews on Google, so I called right away.
                
                The plumber came over within the hour, assessed the problem, did a quick fix, and told me he’d be back the next day with the proper parts. True to his word, he came the next day, fixed the leak, and handed me the invoice. He was prompt and professional, just like his reviews on Google had described him, and I was more than happy to pay the bill. As a result, he became our go-to plumber for any issues, and I referred him to our family and friends in the area. </p>
