            <p><h>Remember choose-your-own-adventure books? </h>You’d be reading the story, and suddenly you had options — multiple paths were laid out for you, and all you had to do was choose. Your decision might lead you on a quest for hidden treasure, or to solve an ancient puzzle, or you could end up in a royal court performing for a king. 

                The goal of the books was simple: give the reader choice. Let them be involved in the process of storytelling. 
                
                In everyday life, we are in a choose-your-own-adventure book. As the great poet Arthur O’Shaughnessy said: “we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams.” Each day we encounter tasks and obstacles and are presented with choices, and in the end, it is up to us to decide which way we’re going to go. 
                
                Behavior-based marketing automation uses this knowledge, this “choose-your-own-adventure” idea, as its very foundation. The marketing automation part makes it easier.
                
               <h>What is behavioral marketing?</h> 
                As humans, we all have a unique way of interacting with the world around us. These interactions manifest behaviors — to put it plainly, they are the ways in which we interact with something or someone. 
                
                We can accept something or reject it, seek something out, commune with it, avoid it, try to own it, play with it, or use it as a tool. These behaviors occur in every facet of our lives — both in the physical world, as well as online. 
                
                And the way we interact with the internet mirrors the behaviors we execute in our physical lives. Online, we have options, and what we choose takes us down a particular path. In behavior-based marketing, you and your business have the opportunity to respond to user choices. 
                
                When a user interacts with an app, a website, an email, or a social media account — that creates data. Collected data from an individual user becomes a trail, a profile of the user, and gives you a clue about what the user wants, about what they’d be willing to invest their time and money into.  </p>
