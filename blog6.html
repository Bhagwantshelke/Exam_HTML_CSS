			<h2>Why Your Business Can’t Afford to Use Purchased Email Lists</h2>
			<p>Last Modified: March 7, 2023</p>
            <p>Email marketing can sometimes feel like a numbers game, and for a good reason: It takes a lot of contacts, messages, and quality content to get results. If the focus is on quantity, there’s a temptation to pursue a quick fix — and there’s no speedy solution quite like a purchased email list. 

                Affordable and extensive, purchased email lists give the purchaser immediate access to numerous email addresses. These may be categorized by job title or demographic groups, and vendors promise that these addresses will expand your reach and build brand awareness. 
                
                The allure of a purchased email list is understandable when you’re desperate to get your business venture off the ground and have little time or money to spare. However, this approach could prove costly, ineffective, or even illegal. 
                
                Thankfully, there’s a better way, and by the time you reach the end of this article, you’ll feel confident about using alternative strategies, many of which are far more accessible than you might have previously assumed.
                
                Below, we’ll touch on the legality of purchased email lists before examining their potential impact on your next marketing initiative. You’ll also learn how to build your email lists for free — and get the long-term marketing results you want.
                
                Can you legally buy email lists?
                Technically speaking, purchased email lists are fair game in the U.S. The reality, however, isn’t so simple. 
                
                While email lists are available for purchase, you aren’t necessarily allowed to send emails to your acquired addresses. We’ll explain this in more detail below as we highlight data privacy legislation in the U.S. and abroad.
                
                Why you should never purchase an email list
                Low cost and easy access to purchased email marketing lists make them appealing to business owners with so much on their plate. But with email marketing, there is no magic fix. </p>
